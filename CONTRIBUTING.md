# Contributing to Social Media Sentiment Analysis Project

First off, thank you for considering contributing to our project! It's people like you that make the open-source community such a fantastic place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make will benefit everybody else and are greatly appreciated.

## How Can I Contribute?

Contributions are not just about submitting code. You can contribute in the following ways:

- Reporting bugs or issues.
- Suggesting enhancements or new features.
- Improving documentation or README files.
- Submitting code fixes or new features.

## Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/yourproject/yourproject/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.

### How To Submit A Good Bug Report

Your report should include the following:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Provide a step-by-step description** of the bug in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

## Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

### How To Submit A Good Enhancement Suggestion

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps** or include mock-ups or diagrams.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Social Media Sentiment Analysis users.

## Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible solution
- Enable a sustainable system for the project's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

### What if the status checks are failing?

If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-evaluate the status check.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Coding Conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

- We indent using four spaces (soft tabs)
- We follow the PEP8 coding conventions for Python, though flexibility is allowed if the reason is well justified.

## Final Words

We appreciate all the help we can get to make this project better! We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that get things working in your environment. There are many ways you can contribute, and we're here to help guide you.
