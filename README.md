# Social Media Sentiment Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze sentiment from social media posts, specifically focusing on customer feedback about products or services. It fetches data from Twitter (with potential for expansion to other platforms), performs sentiment analysis to classify feedback as positive, negative, or neutral, and visualizes the sentiment trends over time.

## Objectives

- **Overall Customer Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the overall sentiment towards the brand.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify how sentiment changes over time.
- **Sentiment Analysis by Product/Service**: Analyze sentiment for specific offerings.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare sentiment across different social media platforms.
- **Feedback and Issue Identification**: Analyze content for specific feedback or recurring themes.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Tweepy**: Library for accessing the Twitter API.
- **NLTK and TextBlob**: Libraries for natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing and querying structured data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQLAlchemy**: SQL toolkit and ORM for Python.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

## Project Structure

# ETL-Pipeline-Project
Develop a pipeline that extracts data from social media APIs (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) performs sentiment analysis on customer feedback, transforms the data for insights, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database

## Setup Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv sa_env` and activate it.
   - Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (create this file based on provided packages).

2. **Database Configuration**:
   - Install PostgreSQL and create a database named `sentiment_analysis`.
   - Update `database.py` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

3. **API Credentials**:
   - Obtain Twitter API credentials and update `twitter.py` accordingly.

4. **Running the Project**:
   - Execute `main.py` to start the data extraction, analysis, and visualization process.

## How to Use

- Update search keywords or parameters as needed in `main.py` or the respective data extraction scripts.
- Run `main.py` to execute the entire pipeline or individual scripts for specific tasks.
